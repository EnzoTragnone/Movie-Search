## Introduction 
 Why did you build this project?

- The idea behiend the project was to provide a central location were movie/tv show information and avaliability could be attained by the user. 

 What problem does it solve?

- The site eliminates the need to make extra searches for streaming avaliability, trailers, movie info, and now playing information for theatres. 

 What did you learn?

Workflow

- Meeting daily and regularly communicating with team members allowed for the project to progress at a steady pace. Team members kept each other informed as to what they were working on and in which branch. This was key, as it avoided overlap in what we were working on and allowed us to identify areas that needed to be taken care of so work could progress. 

- The distrubution of work where everyone had their own tasks each day to work on allowed for a very productive development of the site. Daily meetings and messages over the app 'Slack' allowed everyone to stay informed about how development was progressing and allowed for a dynamic workflow as the project developed. Knowing what features we were to be working on and staying up-to-date on the progress that others were making was key to our success as a team.

- As a movie lover, I want to be able to look up information about a movie and be provided with key information about that title and its availability. 


## Features

### Homepage

- Now showing movies: The homepage on load displays a list of now playing movies with their title and movie poster. On clicking one of the now playing movies a search is triggered and more detailed information about that title is presented to the user.

The ability to display a watchable trailer, and a list of streamining services to check for avaliability is also provided as an option.
