## Introduction 
 Why did you build this project?

- The idea behiend the project was to provide a central location where movie/tv show information and avaliability could be attained by the user. 

 What problem does it solve?

- The site eliminates the need to make extra searches for streaming avaliability, trailers, movie info, and now playing information for theatres. 

 What did you learn?

Workflow

- Meeting daily and regularly communicating with team members allowed for the project to progress at a steady pace. Team members kept each other informed as to what they were working on and in which branch. This was key, as it avoided overlap in what we were working on and allowed us to identify areas that needed to be taken care of so work could progress at a consistent pace. 

- The work was distrubuted so that everyone had their own tasks each day to work on, allowing for a very productive development of the site. Daily meetings and messages over the app 'Slack' allowed everyone to stay informed about how development was progressing and allowed for a dynamic workflow as the project developed. Knowing what features we were to be working on and staying up-to-date on the progress that others were making was key to our success as a team. 

Using GitHub for projects 

- Kanban board: The kanban board acts similiar to creating psuedo code, in that both create an outline of what needs to be done on a project. The kanban board is a convient way for groups to manage and check what work needs to be done, and who is assigned to the task. Creating and making use of this feature on GitHub, in the projects tab, allowed for a convient central location to manage the progress of the project and allowed members to make additions for emerging work tasks. Making use of this feature proved to be an organizanizational asset to the project and implemting its use for solo works would be a benefit as it is easy to use and allows for clear organization of workflow.   

- Creating / Using issues feature: The issues section acts like a message board within a repository. It allows comments to be made for specefic issues and for team members to be assigned or self-assigned specefic issues. The tags are useful for clarity on what an iussue is partaining to, and in general is a convient way for team members to see areas of a project that need to be worked on in conjunction with the kanban board.  
 
- Working in branches: A develop branch was created and branches were created for the development of the sites features. Once a feature was ready to be pushed, a pull request was made to be merged with the devlop branch. Once testing was passed on the develop branch, then it was merged with the main branch. This insured that the main branch remained intact and avoided time loss in having to revert back to a previous build. Working in seperate branched also had the benefit of allowing us to be able to merge specefic changes in a controlled setting.  
 

## User Story
- As a movie lover, I want to be able to look up information about a movie and be provided with key information about that title and its availability. 


## Features

### Homepage

- Now showing movies: The homepage on load displays a list of now playing movies with their title and movie poster. On clicking one of the now playing movies a search is triggered and more detailed information about that title is presented to the user.

The ability to display a watchable trailer, and a list of streamining services to check for avaliability is also provided as an option.

The user does not need to select the same options everytime and this also allows for better quick adjustments to searches.

## Initial Design Concept 

Once the idea for the project was agreed upon, a initial wireframe was created so development could begin on the project. This wireframe included a design for a simple user interface that included a search bar and two sections for information about a searched movie title:

As the project progressed and styling was beginning devlopment, a more refined layout for the information section was created to act as a template for the projects styling. This layout included the placement of the movie information and movie poster:
